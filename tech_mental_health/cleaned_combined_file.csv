It should have come up in all previous workplaces but I never feel safe bringing it up. I freelance now so I can deal with structuring my own work hours etc...but, I am really really struggling both due to isolation and just...freelancing is a real grind. If I didn't have Obamacare I would be completely screwed. AS it is I am only semi screwed. ALSO  - what I wish you would ask in this survey is about caretaking. 
I am female in IT..and disabled. I take care of my elderly mother and my developmentally disabled brother. 
What NEVER gets discussed is who does the caretaking in families when someone breaks down or is unable to work...it's women, sisters, daughters, mothers... So PLEASE work caretaking survey questions into your surveys.

I can't just say it's about me...I'm under water because no one is helping with my brother or mother..least of all my father who died penniless after years on wall street making millions. He was ADHD too...and alcoholic and depressed...but, he was a ""master of the universe"" type doing IPOs for tech companies...and a ""liberatarian""... 

So yeah - please get more intersectional in how you survey this landscape. I'm screwed NOT just because of my disabilities...but my gender as well.

Sooo - this survey should have a ""Did we miss anything"" open question at the end. Two things. One - My ADHD is an asset when treated and understood...Also - When I finally got coverage at work 20 years ago...I was put on a med which I had a very bad reaction to - at work. Getting treated (after decades) ended up cratering my worklife for ten years or so. Wrong meds *really* messed me up - along with wrong DX. I couldn't be open about it. And then had a serious breakdown at work...and was fired immediately. No mercy. No understanding - I told them what was going on and I was gone. Because I wasn't well.. I couldn't defend myself. I became homeless for a while. I'm OK now...but it was a *mess* caused BY getting poor medical treatment for pretty run of the mill depression...I was in Silicon Valley at the time and over 30 and female.
